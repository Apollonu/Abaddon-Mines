# Abaddon Mines
My large scale half expert tech based megapack, this modpack is the pack I intended to make from the start, even before the abaddon series of packs came into fruition. Personally I believe what I have accomplished with this to be special.
This was made modular so I could ramp development through my limits and break them in order to make something unique and polished, within the limits of my freetime..
This pack is based off of [Journey's Gate](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/abaddon-vanilla), which in turn is based off of [Abaddon Client](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/abaddon-client).
You can download [Abaddon Mines](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/abaddon-mines) on CurseForge, others are not allowed to distribute, modify or release files from the modpack in any manner, unto others.
# Changelogs
I like my [changelogs](https://github.com/Apollonu/Abaddon-Client/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) to be extensive, if there are any errors for some reason, make an issue and I will fix it. Do not abuse the Pull request for any reason whatsoever.
